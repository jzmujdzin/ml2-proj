# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a project developed for Machine Learning 2 classes in Python.

## Project Overview

The first project involves building and optimizing machine learning models for predicting wine quality based on various chemical properties. The models used include RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor, SVR, Ridge, Lasso, and KNeighborsRegressor. The project also explores ensemble methods using H2O's AutoML.
The second project leverages the same techniques, but applied to a credit risk problem.

## Important files in this Repository

- `classification_report.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the classification report.
- `regression_report.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the regression report.

## Requirements

This project uses the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- h2o

## How to Run the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks and run the cells.
